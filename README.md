# TTL Controller for Microscope 

<img src="https://github.com/mariavmukhina/TTL_Controller_for_Microscope/blob/main/images/controller-small.jpg">  

An inexpensive TTL controller consisting of Arduino and custom-made printed board that listens to firing TTL pulse from camera and generates up to 8 TTL output pulses. [Software for the controller](https://github.com/mariavmukhina/ScopeScript/tree/main/hardwareControl/piezoController/arduinoFirmware) in Arduino programming language allows to synchronize camera image acquisition with turning on epi or brightfield illumination, moving the piezoelectric Z stage, and applying mechanical deformations to the sample with nanomanipulator, as shown below. The provided files contain design files for the custom printed circuit board (PCB, can be ordered from https://oshpark.com/), the parts list for the PCB, and soldering and assembling instructions.
