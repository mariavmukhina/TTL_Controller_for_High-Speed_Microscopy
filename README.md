An inexpensive TTL controller consisting of Arduino and custom-made printed board that listens to firing TTL pulse from camera and generates up to 8 TTL output pulses. Software for the [controller](https://github.com/mariavmukhina/ScopeScript/tree/main/hardwareControl/piezoController/arduinoFirmware) in Arduino programming language allows to synchronize camera image acquisition with turning on epi or brightfield illumination, moving the piezoelectric Z stage, and applying mechanical deformations to the sample with nanomanipulator, as shown in Figure below.
